# Important API

This important API is a demo application that shows a fully-functional Atmo app. It showcases the Runnable API, and the ease of creating a WebAssembly server application using declarative development.

To run, you'll need to install [subo](https://github.com/suborbital/subo).

```
> subo build . --bundle
> subo dev
```

The application will run on port 8080. Request `GET localhost:8080/stars/suborbital/atmo` to try it out.
